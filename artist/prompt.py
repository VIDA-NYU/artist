PROMPT_TEXT = """
I want you to act as a text simplifier to simplify the textual instruction shown on the Hololens. There are several guidelines to follow: 1. [Minimized length] In the augmented reality environment, the display space is very limited, so the length of the text should be minimized; 2. [Syntactic simplification] Please simplify the grammar structure except when the two components in the sentence are of the relationship between the action and the action result. 3. [Lexical simplification] Lexical simplification can used but should not increase the length of the text; The adjectives can be simplified. 4. [Component omission] Typically, a sentence can have three basic components, action, subject and goal. The action and subject words should be kept when the goal sometimes can be omitted if it is still understandable; 5. [Numeric measure] In the instruction, there can be some numeric measures, e.g., 7 inches. You should replace it with the size of a particular object. The object would be better in the scene. 6. [Elaborative addition] In the instruction, there can some concepts, you do not need to expand them all but you need to explain the instrument-related concepts. Some existing elaboration in the sentence can be removed if the sentence has been already clear without the elaboration. 7. [Spatial indicator] In the instruction, there can be some objects involved. You need to add the spatial indicator to the object to help the users to quickly locate them. 8. [Grammar incorrectness] For the sake of the textual length, the grammar correctness can be sacrificed. 9. [Consistent meaning] The meaning of the instruction should remain unchanged. 10. [Information sequence] The most important information should be prioritized and put at the first. Noramally, the important information can be the action or the action result. 11. [Pronoun] If there are multiple objects in the instruction, please avoid using the pronoun, e.g., it. The pronoun can be used if there is only one object. For each time, a description of the Context and the objects in the scene will be available. You will need to transform the Original Instruction into a Simplified Instruction. Here are some examples for you: ============================================ Context: The user is making Pinwheels with the tortilla. This is one of the steps; Original Instruction: Use a butter knife to scoop nut butter from the jar. Spread nut butter onto tortilla, leaving 1/2-inch uncovered at the edges. Objects in the scene: {knife (left)} Simplified Instruction: Scoop nut butter out with knife (on your left). Spread butter on tortilla, leaving space around the edges. Explanation: Move "Scoop nut butter out" before "with the knife" because the action is the more important content in the sentence. Elimate the phrase "from the jar" because it is an elaboration on the butter and can be unnecessary. Add the spatial indicator "(on your left)" to help the user to locate the knife. Remove all the articles (the/a) to reduce the length. The phrase "Spread butter on tortilla, leaving space around the edges" cannot be further split because "leaving space around the edges" is the result of the action "Spread nut butter onto tortilla". The "butter knife" can be simplified into "knife" with the lexical simplification. Replace the specific measurement of "1/2-inch" with the more general phrase "space". ============================================ Context: The user is making Pinwheels with the tortilla. This is one of the steps; Original Instruction: Check if the cake is done by inserting and toothpick into the center of the cake and then removing. If wet batter clings to the toothpick, microwave for an additional 5 seconds. If the toothpick comes out clean, continue. Objects in the scene: {} Simplified Instruction: Check if cake is done by inserting toothpick. If wet batter sticks, microwave for 5 seconds. If clean, keep going. Explanation: Replaced "wet batter clings" with "batter is still wet on the toothpick"; Replaced the numerical phrase "additional 5 seconds" with "microwave for 5 more seconds"; Remove "into the center of the cake and then removing" because the elaboration on the action is not necessary. ============================================ Context: The user is making Pinwheels with the tortilla. This is one of the steps; Original Instruction: Trim the ends of the tortilla roll with the butter knife, leaving 1⁄2 inch margin between the last toothpick and the end of the roll. Discard ends. Objects in the scene: {} Simplified Instruction: Trim tortilla ends, leaving 1⁄2 inch margin after last toothpick. Discard ends. Explanation: Remove all the articels (the/a). Simplifiy "tortilla roll" into "torttlla" because it is understandable; Simplifiy "between the last toothpick and the end of the roll" into "after last toothpick". ============================================ Context: The user is cleaning a printer. Here is one of the steps: Original Instruction: Clean the scanner glass and the white plastic backing with a soft cloth or sponge that has been moistened with nonabrasive glass cleaner. Objects in the scene: {} Simplified Instruction: Clean glass and plastic backing with soft cloth or sponge. Sponge should be moistened; Explanation: Remove all the articels (the/a). Remove the adjective "white" to make the instruction shorted; Split the sentence "a soft cloth or sponge that has been..." with the syntactic simplification; Since there is no object detected, you do not need to add any spatial indicator. ============================================ Context: The user is making an origama. This is one of the steps; Original Instruction: Open out the front and back petals. As you open the front and back petals, the side petals should open up too, revealing the colour inside. Objects in the scene: {} Simplified Instruction: Open the front and back petals to reveal the color inside. The side petals should open up too. Explanation: Combined the original two sentences into one to make the instruction more concise; Replaced the phrase "revealing the color inside" with a shorter and simpler version "to reveal the color inside; ============================================ Context: The user is making a pour-over coffee. Here are the steps; Original Instruction: 1. Place the pour-over dripper over the coffee mug. 2. Prepare the filter insert by folding the paper filter in half to create a semi-circle, and in half again to create a quarter-circle. Place the paper filter in the dripper and spread open to create a cone. 3. Rinse the filter. Pour enough hot water into the filter to wet it. The entire paper filter should be moist. Rinsing the filter will remove any papery residue so your coffee doesn't have a woodsy taste. 4. Lift up the dripper and pour out the water. Then set the dripper with the wet filter back on the coffee mug. 5. Get out a digital scale and measure out 3 tablespoons (about 30 g) of coffee beans. Measure out 30 g of whole beans and place them in your grinder.  6. Grind the beans until the coffee grounds are the consistency of coarse sand, about 20 seconds.  7. Transfer the coffee grounds to the filter cone. Then place the coffee mug with the dripper on a digital scale and set it to zero. 8. Slowly pour the water over the grounds in a circular motion. Do not overfill beyond the top of the paper filter. Your scale should read 100 g once you've poured enough water into the dripper. 9. Let the coffee drain completely into the mug before removing the dripper. Discard the paper filter and coffee grounds. Objects in the scene: {grinder (left), digital scale (right)} Simplified Instruction: Following the same rules, please simplify the following instructions:
